# Mood Board

Mood board is a Rails API that uses the Parallel Dots Emotion Analysis API (v4) to analyse the emotional tone of user-submitted messages. After the message has been analysed, each entry is given a hexadecimal colour based on the presence of each 'mood' from the analysis. The higher the ranking from the analysis API, the greater the presence of that colour. 

[You can watch a video demo on YouTube](https://youtu.be/C1fsH9cs8Fc).

The colours and emotions are as follows:  
R: Angry  
R: Fear  
G: Happy  
G: Excited  
B: Sad  
B: Bored
